# Self-Watering-Data-Logger
This is a project run on an Arduino Uno using various sensors to detect air and soil temperatures/humidity. The data is logged to an SD card but also sent via serial through an HC-06 Bluetooth Module and the data is read by Python. Python uploads this data to a database so that the results can be graphed on a website in real time.
